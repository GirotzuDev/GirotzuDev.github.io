            AstroBeer is an imaginative game created for a real Game Jam organized by Sabana University and TeravisionGames studios, where we obtained the second overall position among all participants. The game jam lasted for three days, with two days dedicated to development and the final day reserved for awards and recognition. The theme of the game jam revolved around outer space, inspiring the creation of a unique game where the main character is a water beer entrusted with the responsibility of fostering life throughout the galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In AstroBeer, your objective is to discover and visit all the planets within the galaxy, bringing life to each one. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the last planet in the galaxy thrives with life. You'll navigate through space as the water beer, using intuitive controls to rotate the player along the axis. By pressing the space key, you activate propulsion to maneuver through space. When landing on a planet, you can use the "e" key to plant life, fostering its growth and contributing to the overall mission of cultivating life across the galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            AstroBeer showcases the team's creativity and dedication during the game jam, earning them the second overall position among all participants.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
              Alice Eyes is a thrilling horror game developed as a final project for a Unity boot camp. This game incorporates graph theory for the artificial intelligence of the enemies, allowing for advanced patrol, follow, and movement behaviors.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Alice Eyes, players find themselves immersed in a chilling and suspenseful atmosphere. The objective of the game is to discover and collect four crucial objects that unveil a captivating story. Once these four objects are obtained, players must locate and open a chest located in the center of the city to win the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, players must be cautious as they navigate through the game world. They must avoid Alice, a persistent girl who relentlessly searches for the player. Additionally, players need to evade enemies in the form of eyes, aptly named the "Alice Eyes." If an eye spots the player for an extended period, the player becomes frozen and vulnerable to Alice's advances. If caught by Alice, the game is lost.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alice Eyes offers a unique and immersive horror experience, combining strategic exploration, object collection, and evasive tactics to survive and progress through the game.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Epic Can Clash is an exciting multiplayer game that simulates a game jam activity within a boot camp. Created by a group of five individuals, this game jam lasts for a day, where participants collaborate and compete to bring their creative ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Epic Can Clash, each player assumes the role of a can character and engages in intense battles within an arena. The objective is to push the opposing player out of the arena to claim victory. The player who rapidly presses the button gains more force, allowing them to push their opponent with greater speed towards the edges of the arena.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add an additional layer of excitement and strategy, the game features three power-ups that can potentially turn the tables. These power-ups appear at the top of the screen, and the player who successfully destroys the power box by pressing their key first obtains the power. The first power-up adds an extra push force to the player, granting them an advantage. The second power-up swaps the player's position with their opponent, potentially leading to a surprising reversal. The third power-up freezes the enemy for three seconds, providing a strategic advantage during the battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Epic Can Clash offers fast-paced multiplayer action, where timing, button pressing speed, and clever usage of power-ups play a crucial role in determining the victor.
